for ODP support:

  * collect all data pagewise with
    * title
    * content
    * notes
  * then load the template
  * parse out all <page> entries
  * in each page should be a placeholder for
    * title
    * content
    * notes
  * use the matching page number or last if not enough
    * this allows for separate title page
    * needs some adjustments for IDs I guess
  * we need to check for styles
    * might be possible to place them in the master slides?
